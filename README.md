# Project Status

This project is currently **in progress**.  
We are actively developing, restructuring, and refining the codebase.  

The full source code and detailed documentation will be released **once the project reaches a stable stage** and the refactoring process is complete.

# LATTE
LATTE employs Efficient Multiscale Spatial Aggregation (EMSA) to capture spatial features across scales, Memory Attention Aggregation (MAA) to enhance temporal modeling, and Auxiliary Self-Attention Aggregation (AAA) to extract latent dependencies over extended sequences. Additionally, LATTE incorporates the Flamingo Alert-Assisted System (FAA), leveraging a vision-language model to provide real-time, interpretable verbal hazard alerts, improving passenger situational awareness. Evaluations on benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate LATTE’s superior predictive capabilities and computational efficiency.
